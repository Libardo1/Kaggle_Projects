This is my first Kaggle Competition 

The purpose of this project is to run through the whole process of a machine learning project, and of course, get a prize if possible. Ideas used in feature engineering were partly collected from the competition community and partly contributed by my own.

Achievement: 
  1. Went throught the whole process;
  
  2. Built a template for future use;
  
  3. Got a REAL knowledge of how the quality of dataset could influence the model;
  
  4. Learned how to work with limits set by my laptop, mostly RAM;/
