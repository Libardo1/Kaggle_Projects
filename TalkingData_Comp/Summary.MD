This is my first Kaggle Competition /

The purpose of this project is to run through the whole process of a machine learning project, and of course, get a prize if possible. Ideas used in feature engineering were partly collected from the competition community and partly contributed by my own./

Achievement: 
\t1. Went throught the whole process;/
\t2. Built a template for future use;/
\t3. Got a REAL knowledge of how the quality of dataset could influence the model;/
\t4. Learned how to work with limits set by my laptop, mostly RAM;/
